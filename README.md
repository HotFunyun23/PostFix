Assignment Instructions

With a random partner, you will be creating a Java program that calculates the result of a user-supplied mathematical expression in postfix  (Links to an external site.)notation. You will likely find your Stack class useful here, so take some time together to decide which partners code you'd like to use.

Please submit the assignment via a link to Github, your repo should be a DIFFERENT REPO than your Stack/StackNode repository.

 

Example run:

Please enter an expression in postfix notation (separated by spaces): 3 4 8 * + 7 +
Great! Here it the result: 42
